This is the folder for my work for my MBA Data Analytics Capstone from Jan-Mar 2020. 
The project focused on finding analytical approaches to manage exchange rate risk by either exchange rate prediction or porfolio management
Structurely, we follows three different approaches, representing solution for different time horizon, to tackle this problem:
#1. Short-term horizon - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)
#2. Medium-term horizon - Momentum & Carry Trade
#3. Long-term horizon - Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)

Literature review
The currency estimation and forecasting domain is an area of research that spans multiple dimensions.It seemed as though any time series modeling of currency behavior needed to be described in terms of both the forward-looking horizon of the model, as well as the foundations upon which the model derived its explainability - either from statistics or from macroeconomics
While the short-term horizon contains research centered on both technical and fundamental approaches, the highest performing models in that area were of technical design. The intermediate horizon focuses more so on structural macroeconomic models and strategic approaches. The long-term horizon is almost exclusively focused on macroeconomic fundamentals, as over time, short-term market deviations give way to a long-run steady-state determined by fundamental macroeconomic factors. In this way, we can define our ultimate solution space two-dimensionally - based on temporal horizon as well as the underlying scientific approach
