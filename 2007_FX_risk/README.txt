This is the folder for my work for my MBA Data Analytics Capstone from Jan-Mar 2020. 
The project focused on finding analytical approaches to manage exchange rate risk by either exchange rate prediction or porfolio management
Structurely, we follows three different approaches, representing solution for different time horizon, to tackle this problem:
#1. Short-term horizon - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)
#2. Medium-term horizon - Momentum & Carry Trade
#3. Long-term horizon - Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
