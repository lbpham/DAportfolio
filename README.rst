Data Analytics Portfolio @ lbpham
============

This Github includes codes, notebook, and output from some of my data analytics projects. 
Most of the projects were started due to my interest in certain topics/questions, for example:

- Retail landscape in Vietnam, focusing on analyzing the physical stores footprint of leading retailers.
- Development in Vietnam business landscape, a snapshot at the top 10 private companies in Vietnam.

Some of them are part of my academic assignment from my Master program at Carnegie Mellon University, for example:

- Managing Exchange Risk: Building a holistic solution from different approaches designed for different time-horizon.
- Bike-lane in Pittsburgh: Where should the cities puting bikelane?
