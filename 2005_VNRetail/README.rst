============
Vietnam Retail Footprint Analysis [2019]
============

This project is my work for the IBM-Coursera Applied Data Science Capstone. 

I aimed to answer the following question to gain better understanding of landscape regarding store footprint:

- How is the current retail footprint of these retail giants in Vietnam?
- Which province/city/district should be the next target for new stores?
- How the store footprint of leading brands compared to each other in terms of coverage and efficiency?

For the full report and analysis, you can ready my blog post on Medium:
