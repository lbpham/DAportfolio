This is the folder for my work for my MBA Data Analytics Capstone from Jan-Mar 2020. 
The project focused on finding analytical approaches to manage exchange rate risk by either exchange rate prediction or porfolio management
In this project, we follows three different approaches to tackle this topic as follow:
#1. Short-term FX prediction - Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)
#2. Medium-term risk management - Momentum & Carry Trade
#3. Long-term FX prediction - Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
